# Iron-Butterflies-Around-Earnings
This was one of my summer projects for QFS. I wrote it in a way to try to make it accessible for other members of our club that may not be familiar with some of the 
technical portions of the project. Also note that there is not too much detailed discussion of research results and steps along the way, mainly because I made this
to present in front of people, i.e. the goal was to provide visuals and simple explanations and explain in more detail verbally. Still, the written text should give a 
pretty good understanding of the main ideas.
